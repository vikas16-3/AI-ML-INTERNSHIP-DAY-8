# 🧠 Task 8: Clustering with K-Means

## 🎯 Objective
This project demonstrates the application of *Unsupervised Machine Learning* using the *K-Means Clustering* algorithm. The primary goal is to explore and understand data clusters without labeled outcomes.

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries
- Python
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## 📁 Dataset
-[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) - Mall Customer Segmentation Data
## 🧪 Tasks Performed
1. Importing necessary libraries.
2. Loading and exploring the dataset.
3. Visualizing the dataset to understand patterns.
4. Applying the *KMeans* algorithm:
   - Deciding number of clusters (possibly using Elbow method).
   - Fitting the model.
   - Visualizing the clusters and centroids.
5. Analyzing the results.

## 📊 Output
- Cluster plots displaying different groups discovered by the model.
- Centroid positions visualized on the plot.

## 📌 Key Concepts
- Unsupervised Learning
- KMeans Clustering
- Elbow Method
- Cluster Visualization

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open Task_8.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run all cells to view clustering outputs and visualizations.
